## ios Udemy Feeder

This is a true opportunity to create an iOS application from nothing. A really basic knowledge of any programming language is required, and the forum is opened for any question you may have. Instead of trying to put a lot of material from different areas, we are using the tools that exist on the internet, that will make our life simpler. Creating an application can be really expensive. Depending on the source, creating an app can be extremely expensive if you don't have the knowledge ([this is my source](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2013/11/24/much-cost-develop-app-true-expense-starting-scratch/?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=share%20button&awesm=tnw.to_qBLM&utm_campaign=social%20media&utm_content=How%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20develop%20an%20app?%20The%20true%20price%20of%20starting%20from%20scratch))... So, why don't you give a shot at this course and try to create your own application instead of expending a lot of money.
